Edit the nav/nav_links elements so that they are spaced according to the image above.


Edit the pricing class so that the elements align along the bottom.  As long as it aligns along the bottom we don't care if the cards aren't the same height.


The card elements should have a solid border 2px of #45ADDD and use flex-basis of 325px. 


No part of the gallery should be visible.


Without using list-style-type add the thumbs up entity as shown in the cards. This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it.**For some people the thumbs up is not printing as yellow. That is fine. */
